    "description": "“Garrett is a go-getter with strong knowledge of JavaScript and React who is able to pick up any task given to him. In the about a year that I got to be his senior, I was consistently impressed with his ability to take on new tasks and also know the right questions to ask to find the best possible solution to any problem. He is a quick learner who I never needed to follow up on any task with as he followed up proactively with me when he ran into any issues. Overall, I think Garrett would be an excellent addition to any team or solo situation and I would be comfortable providing my recommendation for him for any position.”",
